Getting the top influencer given a comma-separated file to represent some Twitter users and the users they follow. In “twitter.csv” file, each row represents a certain user’s id and the id of another user he/she follows.

# Project aim 
This project is to make a program that stores this data in a suitable data structure that
helps the program to retrieve the Top-influencer that has the highest number of followers,
when required, and then the next Top-influencer and so on.
Additionally, this project time complexity analysis illustration is supported to the program’s algorithm in
a pdf document.

closest group of Twitter users to recommend as a new friend. Closest means they have at
least a threshold number of Twitter accounts in common. One of the following program responsibilities in this is to determine this threshold.
